Messaging-Tutorial
==================

This a set of exercises intended for use as part of a tutorial on messaging. The tutorial is first intended to be given at the Progressive.NET 2012 conference, hosted by SkillsMatter between 29-31 May 2012.

Clone the code here to work on the exercises. Sections of the code are marked as TODO. These are parts that are intended to be completed in the tutorial. Sections marked as HINT give some clues on how to implement them, additional to the information given in the presentation associated with these exercises.

The order of the exercises is important as thet build on each other - looking ahead will give clues as to the implementation of earlier exercises and will spoil your learning.

The order is:

- Hello World
- Polling Consumer
- Event Driven Consumer
- Content Based Router
- Dynamic Router
- Dynamic Recipient List
